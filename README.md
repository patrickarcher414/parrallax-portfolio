#Parrallax Portfolio

This is a professional portfolio for Front-End Web developement. 

## Parrallax Effect

I used the ``` background-attachment: fixed;``` and ```z-index``` to acheive a Parrallax Effect in the Hero section.

I added a sticky Nav Bar that scrolls into view and stays at the top of the page as you scroll to the bottom.
