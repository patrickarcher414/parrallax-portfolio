#Parrallax Portfolio

This is a professional portfolio for Front-End Web developement. 

## Parrallax Effect

I used the ``` background-attachment: fixed;``` and ```z-index``` to acheive a Parrallax Effect in the Hero section.

I created a Floating animation on the H1 using ```@keyframes``` and the ```tranform: translate()``` method.

I made a rotating cube with the icons of technologies I have experience with. To accompliah this I used ```animation`` and defined the angles of rotation for each side of the cube.

I added a sticky Nav Bar that scrolls into view and stays at the top of the page as you scroll to the bottom.
